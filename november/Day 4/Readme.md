## Problem Description

You are given a sorted array of integers, `nums`, where all integers appear twice except for one. Your task is to find and return the single integer that appears only once.

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Time Limit:** 30 minutes

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq \) `nums.length` \( \leq 10^3 \)
- \( 0 \leq \) `nums[i]` \( \leq 10^3 \)
- Every element in the array appears exactly twice except for one element
- The array is sorted in ascending order

## Requirements

Your solution must meet the following complexity requirements:

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log n) \) or better
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
